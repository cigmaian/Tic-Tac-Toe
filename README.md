I used this project to practice simple algorithms and using event listeners.

## Knowledge gained

This was rebuilt after decidign to restart from scratch again. Through this experience, I learn to more effectively organize my code with modular functions, writing cleaner code with as less duplication, and to keep everything tuck into their own private scope. I learn from this experience that breaks are best for upmost prodcutivity. Spending 10-20 minutes pre-planning the steps I will take boost my performance as well.
